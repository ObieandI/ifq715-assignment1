## About the Website

Baeshore Swimwear is a fictional brand created for this assignment. The website allows users to browse swimwear collections, view detailed product information, and simulate a shopping experience.
The build emphasizes clean UI design, semantic HTML structure, and CSS styling to deliver a professional e-commerce experience.

The site includes three core pages:

- **Home Page** (index.html): Showcases featured products and categories.
- **Product Page** (product.html): Displays full product details including images, description, and pricing.
- **Add Product Page** (add-product.html): Simulates admin/product upload functionality.
